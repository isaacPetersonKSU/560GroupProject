Project Summary: 
		Our project will be a tool football fans can use to view a varity of stats peraining 
	to a particular NFL season. The front end will be a windows froms desktop app with logic
	layer writen in C#, and a backend database made with microsoft SQL server. 
		From the GUI, users will be able to select a type of stat (like number of touchdowns, sacks etc)
	from a drop-down menu, and filter the results to show the full season or a particular game. The 
	desired list, will be generated by a SQL query and displayed on the GUI. Users will also be able to
	search team-specific, and game-specific stats the same way.

Technical Details:
	GUI:			Windows froms
	Logic Layer:	C#
	Back End:		Microsoft SQL Server
	
Data Interaction: (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE)
	Teams: SELECT
		Team is a static table, because all teams are 
		determined before the season starts.

	TeamPlayers: SELECT, INSERT
		New Players can be inserted 

	Players: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE
		New Players can be inserted, and names and numbers could be
		updated
		
	TeamGames: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE
		Since which teams will play in certain particular games is 
		not determined until after the season starts, rows can be 
		added to this table as data becomes avalable. The score 
		column can be updated as the game is played.
		
	Games: SELECT, UPDATE
		Games are determined before the season starts, but they can
		be moved to a different location or rescheduled.
		
	PlayerGames: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE
		Players can be added to this as stats become avalible for them,
		and updated as the stats change.
		
	TeamTypes: SELECT, INSERT
		colmns will be inserted here to correspond with TeamGames as it 
		is added to.
